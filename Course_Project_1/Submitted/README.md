# coursera-cleaning-data-project
Repository for the Course Project "Getting and Cleaning Data".

In this repo, you can find:

* run_analisys.R that executes the cleaning process
* CodeBook.md that describes the variables
* final_tidy_dataset.txt that contains the dataset generated by running the run_analisys.R script

#Description of the Script
The assigment comprises of five steps, as described bellow.

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

To accomplish these steps we have written a script called run_analysis.R that does all the required work.
